- Add a comments section to posts, or have an email address for readers to respond to
- Get a cool cartoon banner at the top of a doge and a lobster fighting at dusk, maybe commission Zoey to draw it
<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zHrcg16PbJ8/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="doge and lobster" width="400"/>
    - Maybe generate it with AI? A doge and a lobster fighting at dusk. Doge is all angry looking, clearly mid-growl. He's in the bottom left
- Some things 
- Make it so [this](https://gyazo.com/d7d8a7ed3a59de6126f240158362ece5) screen has a small image on the right of a cute doge. This is to squish our articles horizontally a bit, ensuring that they don't have too much space (which makes sure that they're short and bite-sized)
